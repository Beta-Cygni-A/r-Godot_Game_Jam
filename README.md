# reddit-Godot_Game_Jam

reddit Godot Game Jam is a game jam to celebrate 100k subs on r/godot. Due to no collabertors, I have re-oriented the project to port the simple 2D Flash Game "Flash Trek: Assualt" by Vex Xiang, to Godot in a modular way. Join the force and help make this project a reality!
