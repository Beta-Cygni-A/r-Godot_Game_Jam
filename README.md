# reddit-Godot_Game_Jam

reddit Godot Game Jam is a game jam to celebrate 100k subs on r/godot. Due to no collaborators, I have reoriented the project to port the simple 2D Flash Game "FlashTrek: Assualt" by Vex Xiang, to Godot in a modular way. Description of Flash Trek: Assualt from https://stexpanded.fandom.com/wiki/Flashtrek#FlashTrek:_Assault 

> "According to Vex Xiang, he created FlashTrek: Assault over a single weekend. It stands out from other FlashTrek games because it is a simple defense game rather than a spacecraft RPG. Instead of controlling a single starship, the player commands a space station accompanied by an entire fleet of computer-controlled starships that essentially act as static weapon emplacements.  Enemies come in huge waves, with one wave per level. For each enemy destroyed, points are earned in an arcade fashion. The player can either try to destroy all enemies manually by using the starbase's main phaser weapon, or use points to buy ships to do the same job automatically. At the end of each level, the play has the ability to use points to buy upgrades and abilities to compensate for the growing strength of the enemy."

Join the force and help make this project a reality!

Here is a picture of the original Flash Game in Action.
