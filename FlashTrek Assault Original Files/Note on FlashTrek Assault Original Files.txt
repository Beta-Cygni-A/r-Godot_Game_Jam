I got the swf from FlashPoint. I decompiled the swf with JPEXS Decompiler. 

Folder "Exported Files" has the files created when the button "Export All Parts" was pressed.
Folder "fla" has the fla created when the button "Export to fla" was pressed.
Folder "xml" has the xml created when the button "Export swf xml" was pressed.
Folder "swf" has the swf in it.
