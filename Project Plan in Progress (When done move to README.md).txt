Some notes:

define goal: "port FlashTrek: Assault from Flash to Godot"

define requirments: "No changes to the game till original is replicated"

Define your tools, targets, and backup plan: "Godot engine, target is pc, mobile, web, windows, linux, android, 
and maybe ios and mac. Mac and ios not priority. PC is priority."

Break hard problems down into easy problems: "already done"

Figure out the sequence of events: "the game was made frame by frame"

Outlining your main function: "i think that is already done"

Implement each function: "yep now to do it"


Advice
Keep your programs simple to start.
Add features over time
Focus on one area at atime
Test each piece of code as you go
Don't invest in perfecting early code
